Surprise!
Look outside!
What a glorious white X-mas!
Ding, dong, ding, dong!
Well, if you haven't guessed ^already, I'm the rat!
It's me, Gabe!
Here is the news:
Today, a child is born!
Somewhere, I'm sure!
Oh man, is he ugly!
I'm getting nauseous just thinking^about it!
Stop it! Put it back!
Anyway...
SO MUCH WORK WAS PUT INTO THIS
At least 5 hours
So you better appreciate it!
Just kidding
No I mean do appreciate it 
Wait
Ahhhhhhhh something is happening
(Suddenly, Roger's will possesses^the rat)
I had a bunch of ideas 
But I wanted to get this to you^in time for X-mas day 
And all my ideas were too big to^do that fast
Thus much time was spent not^making a lick of progress
Good thing I came up with^something easy to do
At the last minute
(The snow has been done for days)
Maybe, if you play your cards^right,
Some sledding kids can be added
I have a neat idea for an^animation system
(Gabe fights desperately for^control)
(Gabe successfully wrests^control)
Phew!
I sure the holidays!
Yay! Blegh! Hmm!
So...
Drink some hot cider
Or some goopy Italian hot^chocolate
I heard it's good
Or just look at this for way too^long
It's quite hypnotizing
I do enjoy this demoscene vibe
And now it's lunchtime
I'm getting hungry
(Imagine Gabe eating something^iconic)
Hope this is okay
I know it's not very professional
Though I'm not getting paid^anything for this
Afterwards I'm meeting up with^some friends
We're supposed to eat food
But I can't wait
I can't control myself
...
...
That's all.
Stay away from drugs, kids!
Loo,loo,loooo,loo,loooo,loooo,^loooo...
Loo,loo,loo,looooo,loo,loo,loo,^loooo...
