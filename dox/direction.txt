it's as capable as Ramen
but the code looks like ColorForth and Dark Blue
and it feels like Studio to use
if I can make it feel like TestPad too though... (that one felt like a miracle ... magical)
it follows all the right principles:
    small code
    try to do things as simply as possible
    try to use and extend Forth instead of treating it only as the "language you're using"
    don't worry about memory too much
    document externally
