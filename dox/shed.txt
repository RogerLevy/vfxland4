the (tool)shed is a visual interactive development environment

Control Scheme

	F1...F12	Select Workspace
	Shift-Tab   Toggle the Static Layer (always off when viewing Workspace 12)
    Ctrl-Tab    Toggle Edit Mode
    Delete      Delete selection

SHED context menu

[x] bring
[x] clone
[x] clear
[x] trash
[x] enable/disable snapping (affects dragging, scaling, and resizing)
[ ] scale
[ ] resize
[ ] group (multiple selection)
[x] attach (selection to right-clicked object)
[x] detach
[x] downstage, upstage
[ ] edit text (can be turned off for binary data)
[x] deselect (selects ROOT)
[x] bolt/lock

[x] <tab> toggles the REPL; allows entering commands, and picking and moving of anything not bolted down
[x] when neither the SHED nor the REPL are on, an application gets keyboard and mouse focus
    therefore if any of the SHED's editing features are wanted in parts of an app they have to be implemented there
[ ] keyboard focus can be stolen by an object

When editmode is on...
[x] scroll the workspace with <rmb>
[x] zoom the workspace with the mousewheel (0.25x...2x)
[x] the STATIC layer (Workspace 12) never scrolls and can contain some locked common tools.

--- Misc notes ---

- you can load multiple instances of a program just by including it again.

- when loading a figure,
    named objects are matched to corresponding words if they exist, which are then reassigned.
    (^this is a function of NAME / NAMED.)
    if the root of a figure is named, any object with a matching name is replaced. (the old one is removed/deleted.)
    LOAD picks the loaded figure, good in case of error, you can delete it immediately
