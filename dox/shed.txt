the (tool)shed is an interactive development extension

1/18 idea:
all SHED hotkeys available in REPL mode with ctrl modifier

[x] <f3> enables/disables halting of the game when the REPL is onscreen
[-] <tab> toggles the REPL; allows entering commands, and picking and moving of anything not bolted down
[ ] <`> toggles the SHED and has some hotkeys when REPL is not on
[ ] when neither the SHED nor the REPL are on, an application gets keyboard and mouse focus
    therefore if any of the SHED's editing features are wanted in parts of an app they have to be implemented there
[ ] keyboard focus can be stolen by an object

When SHED is on...
[ ] <f1...f12> can be assigned to switch between 12 workspaces
[x] scroll the workspace with alt + lmb
[x] zoom the workspace with the mousewheel (0.25x...2x)
[-] the STATIC layer never scrolls and contains some locked common tools.
[ ] shift + <`> toggles the STATIC layer

--- Misc notes ---

- you can load multiple instances of a program just by including it again.

- when loading a figure,
    named objects are matched to corresponding words if they exist, which are then reassigned.
    (^this is a function of NAME / NAMED.)
    if the root of a figure is named, any object with a matching name is replaced. (the old one is removed/deleted.)
    LOAD picks the loaded figure, good in case of error, you can delete it immediately
