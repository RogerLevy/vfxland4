[x] aed shouldn't be moving timelines
    --- Fixed by adding a way to drag items with arbitrary scaling applied ---
    A. some kind of proxy object
        affected words:
            O. EACH CLEAR PUSH DRAW RESPOND (not ACT or PHYSICS)
        on delete, the target needs to unlink the proxy
    B. don't actually move the timeline/keyframe, draw it and re-implement the shed
    C. create a copy and continually update the original

[x] PRIVATE and PUBLIC
    PRIVATE automatically creates a wordlist with the name of the current file
    to be used with FGET ?
    the wordlists automatically add themselves to the search order
    to reset the search order, ONLY FORTH or maybe a shorthand
[x] Update shed.txt, ui.txt (rename to repl.txt),
[ ] There are some issues related to serializing and replacement
    Stale references - solve by never reassigning, only replacing? 
    But then there is the issue of children
    One solution is to make all references (i.e. name-words) work like variables (i.e. you have to @ from them),
        then we can reassign without worry
    Replacement *is* possible, if we're only reusing the memory slot, not
        preserving tree structure.  <--- THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT
    This will be built into NAME which will copy the entire source slot to the destination slot,
        removing all the destination's children - but not yet freeing them, because there might be
        some named slots there!  So we put them in a holding area ... [then idk]
    The only caveat with this is if the just-created object is stored anywhere before NAMED or NAME is called on it,
        it will become a stale reference...

    [x] Add ability to bring objects from one workspace to another
        *** There can only be one instance of every named tool/app but it can be brought anywhere, even its pieces. ***
        The keyboard controls only work when the app is attached to a workspace (for now)
        idea: transport widget for preview (play/pause, stop, prev/next keyframe)
            you can bring the preview anywhere along with the transport controls
